# OutrospectionGame
A role-playing game written in C++, with a flat artstyle inspired by the first two Paper Mario RPGs.

This game is written from scratch with no physics, collision, or game engine using purely C++.
The game works in OpenGL, using modern style and should be compatible with any Windows computer that
can run OpenGL 3.0+.
